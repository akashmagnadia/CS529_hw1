        The purpose of this visualization is to show statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of
        Georgia.
        This visualization is created in order to inform the public about the severity of the ongoing pandemic and help
        officials understand how their community is being affected so that they can shape policies to curb the spread of
        the coronavirus.
        The theme and color scheme stays consistent throughout the visualization.
        For example, the color for females is always red and for males is always blue.
        The interface also supports visualization for people who are Green-ColorBlind or have Deuteronomy.
        This is a good thing as it considers people with certain disabilities to have access to the data and does not
        restrict them from any information.
        The line graph for COVID over time makes looking at the data more pleasing as it gives the gist of the trend
        without looking at each bar closely.
        For different counties on the line graph, there are different colors used with legends.
        When a user hovers over the legends that pacific set of data is highlighted.
        For any of the data formats except for tables, users can hover over a bar for a bar chart,
        a portion of the pie for a pie chart,
        and a line point in a line graph to get more details information.
        This is a helpful feature for anyone who would like to go dig deeper into COVID-19 in Georgia.

    <h1> Why this color scheme for the website I am creating? </h1>

    <p>
        After discussing what I liked about the visualization shown above I would like to discuss the reasoning behind
        choosing this color scheme for my website.
        Creating color scheme that creates high contrast makes it more readable and I believe that adding colors don't
        add anymore dimensions to the information.
        Therefore, I have created a basic black and white theme for this website.
